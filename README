This project is only useful in its current form if you embed info the same way as our firmware hex files (which is extremely unlikely).  I'm putting it out there for people in my group and because it might be a useful reference to someone else (especially the hex file parsing and checksum).  It also shows how you can assign a python script to a context menu entry, use a dialog box, and read/write the clipboard in Windows.

Requires win32 extensions

AppInfo.py - Calculates the checksum of the hex file and compares it to the 
             embedded checksum.  Also reads the firmware version and PWBA ID.
             
To install:
Put the script where you want it to reside.
Double-click the AppInfo.py file
Click 'Yes' for the registry disclaimer.

To move the script to a new location:
Move the AppInfo.py file to the new location
Use the install instructions above

To update the script:
Just copy the new version over the old version, no need to reinstall.

To use:
Right-click on a hex or sum file and select Smart Remote App Info.
Click 'Yes' if you want the checksum copied to the clipboard, 'No' if not.
